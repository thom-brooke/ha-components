# HA-Components

This repository contains various components that I have developed for my own Home Assistant (HA) installation.  They are provided in the hope that they are useful to others, but I have expended little or no effort to make them accessible.

The code attempts to follow the same patterns as other HA integrations -- as near as I could figure them out.  The integrations built-in to HA seem to come from several different generations of design and style guidelines; so even when they are doing the same thing, they do it in various different ways.

I wish I cared enough to take the time to package these components more cleanly, to make your effort to use them easier.  But I don't.  That's not a reflection on you.  It's just that I've already spent _entirely_ too much time fighting with HA to get these things working (mostly), and I'm not spending any more.  Sorry.
